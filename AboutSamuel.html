        <p><h3>
            - My highest level of education that I stand at as of now is a high school diploma from Solon High School.
I have some work experience, as it started when i was in high school. I started working at Panera Bread as a Line Chef. Panera Bread is a semi-fast food
restaurant that is primarily known for serving baked-foods. 



        </h3></p>

        <p><h3>- Unfortunately, I had to leave my job as a Line Chef and relocate to Kenya due to family affairs around June 2021. Since then, I have tried
            to stay on my toes, but it was to no avail until i encountered an advertisement on Youtube that concerned the Moringa Programming Course. I was amazed
            and I gave it a shot. I joined Moringa to acquire programming skills that can help build a portfolio for future job opportunities. And as far as this
            course is concerned, I am not disappointed. It has truly opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of what you can do with coding.</h3></p>

            <p><h3> - I enjoy listening to and playing music over my freetime. Music is my interest, skill and hobby rolled into one.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>Projects that I have created are as follows: <ul>
                <li><h4>AboutSamuel: https://github.com/samkigs/AboutSamuel</h4></li>
            </ul></h3></p>
